==== Command Format

* Please note the words in UPPER_CASE are the parameters that you can supply
 ** e.g.
in `ADD i/DESCRIPTION`, `DESCRIPTION` is a parameter which can be used as `ADD i/apple`.
* Items in square brackets are _optional_ and you can omit them.
 ** e.g `EDIT 1 [i/DESCRIPTION] [p/PRICE] [q/QUANTITY]` can be used as `EDIT 1 i/apple p/4.00` or as `EDIT 1 i/apple`.
// @@author kokjoon97
* All command words are case-sensitive and you should always use uppercase.
 ** e.g `ADD` in `ADD i/DESCRIPTION` consists of only uppercase letters.
* You can supply parameters for the `ADD` and `EDIT` command, namely `DESCRIPTION`, `QUANTITY` and `PRICE`, in any order.
 ** e.g `ADD i/apple q/5` *AND* `ADD q/5 i/apple` should both produce the same result.
* The keyword for the `FIND` command is case-insensitive.
 ** e.g If you have an item named "apple" in the list, both `FIND APPLE` *AND* `FIND apple` will display this entry to the user.

== Additional information

=== 1. Loading and saving your shopping list

All your shopping list and budget data are saved to JSON files after you exit the application.
This data is also retrieved from the same JSON files the next time you boot up Shoco.
No further action is required from you as this is an automatic process.

=== 2. Automated budget tracker

When the total cost of the items in your shopping list exceeds the stored budget amount, a message will be displayed which states by how much you have overrun your current budget.
This message will only stop appearing when you increase your budget amount sufficiently or remove enough items from your list to keep within your budget.

== FAQ

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another computer?

*A*: Simply transfer the JSON files that contain your SHOCO data onto the new computer and place them in the folder that contains the SHOCO app.
If the folder already has the JSON files, replace them.

// @@author kokjoon97

*Q*: Is it possible to restore a list that I have deleted?

*A*: Unfortunately, we are still working on this feature and there is no such functionality at this point in time.
It is however, possible to manually backup the `shoppinglist.json` file from time to time so that if you unintentionally cleared your list, you can always replace the empty `shoppinglist.json` file with your backed up version.
